A Day In a Bug’s Life

Project Description: The aim of the project was to give some attention to the tiny animals that are usually being ignored by human beings. Human ego made us value only the life lived by ourselves and because of that, a bug's life has little to no importance nowadays. I was trying to create a mood that makes the audience realize how diverse and different life can be around us.

Process: First, our film was about the reality through a bug’s eyes, which is in a way symbolic; we always view and weigh things around us based on our own vision, not taking into account how other organisms view them. Then, I tried to include as many cute bugs in my webpage as possible to keep them in the center of audience attention. Interesting facts about them were incorporated as well.

Reflection/Evaluation: A concept like this could indeed be designed in much more interesting and advanced ways. Because of time constraints, my lack of web design skills and experience, the result did not turn out as influential as I was expecting it to be. For example, having moving and flying bugs all over the page like here https://auz.github.io/Bug/ would make the project look a lot more interactive and compelling.
